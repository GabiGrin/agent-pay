# AgentPay 💳🤖

**Give your AI agents spending power — without the risk.**

Agent treasury management for the agentic era: pre-funded wallets, spending rules, audit trails, and human-in-the-loop for what matters.

## Status: Pre-launch

We're building in public. Star/watch for updates.

## The Problem

Agents can browse, code, and book flights — but they can't spend money safely. Current options suck:
- 🔓 Hardcode your credit card (scary)
- 🐌 Manually approve everything (slow)
- 🚫 Don't give agents spending power (limiting)

## The Solution

Virtual cards with agent-native controls:
- Pre-funded wallets with hard limits
- Merchant allowlists / blocklists
- Per-transaction caps
- Real-time alerts
- Human approval for high-risk purchases
